# file-upload Challenge 6

----------------------

Hey, I've been talking to my co-owner, and he doesn't believe me that these vulnerabilities we've had are a big deal.

I need something from you I could give him that would show him the magnitude of the problem.

What exactly can you do with these vulnerabilities? Can you see how far you can take them?

A friend passed along this [php web shell](https://github.com/breakthenet/tools/blob/master/shell.php) - try it out, the username is "breakthe" and the pass is "net". You'll have to figure out how to upload it yourself (use any of the upload pages on the server).

Thanks!
