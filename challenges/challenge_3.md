# file-upload Challenge 3

----------------------

Geez. This is harder than I thought. Ok, based on your advice I dropped the client-side mime type validation and am trying something new.

The code should now actually validate that what is being uploaded is a real image, with real dimensions and real mime-types.

There's no way you should be able to bust past this one.

It's available in game, you'll see it in the menu on the left with the title "Preferences: Challenge 3".

Thanks again for your help!

   You can actually insert a comment inside a GIF, which anything processing that GIF ignores. That comment could be anything... it could even have characters like < and ? in it. [GIMP, a free software for manipulating images, will allow you to insert comments in gifs.](http://s116.photobucket.com/user/bayououtdoor/media/gifcomment.gif.html)
