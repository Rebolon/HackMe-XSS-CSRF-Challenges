# file-upload Challenge 4

----------------------

This is driving me nuts - the arcane knowledge required for your last trick is ridiculous.

I noticed a trend in all your exploits though. You required the file to end with .php to get your code to run. I'm going to go back to my file extension checker and just fix that up to ONLY check the last extension on a file. I also got a request in my forums to support an obscure image format called "1337", so I'm adding that to the whitelist.

The new code is available in game, you'll see it in the menu on the left with the title "Preferences: Challenge 4".

Thanks again for your help!
