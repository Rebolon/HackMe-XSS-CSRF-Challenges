# file-upload Challenge 5

----------------------

...

Ok, I will cease listening to users - can't trust them. I dropped support for the "1337" extension - and to be safe, I quarantined the preferences in an iframe (I heard iframes can help contain hackers). You'll have to be more creative if you want to get past my code now! 

The new code is available in game, you'll see it in the menu on the left with the title "Preferences: Challenge 5".

  His iframe idea was both a bad idea and poorly coded, and merits investigation.

   Does the include() php function care what the extension of the file is?

   This challenge is two-part. Part 1 is getting your code to a local file on his server (with an image extension). Part 2 is using the local file inclusion vulnerability to load in your 'image' as though it was code.
